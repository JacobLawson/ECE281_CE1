The simulation results can be found by clicking the box below. Sorry I could not get the picture to show up properly. I tried both ways.

## Analysis of Waveform

The waveform showed a nice graphical representation of the truth table. A 0 corresponded to a 0 value on the graph, while a 1 showed a raised square on the graph. By looking at the graph, it was easy to tell what line of the truth table we were on and what state each variable was on
